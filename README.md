Higher performance and stable video watching experience on the web.

Some streaming sites video players suck. This add-on will replace them with
browser built-in video player for higher performance and more stable
experience. Currently, it supports YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Dailymotion,
Break, Metacafe, Lego and even more sites are coming.

**NOTE:**
This extension will change the page content of the supported video streaming
sites. As a result, many extensions that depends on this content may not work
as expected.
